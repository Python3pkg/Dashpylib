##This is a repository for a dash-cli python wrapper module. Feel free to help me out! pull away! 
Check out commit summary for details 
my first goals are to make functions inside the `pydash` module which would include

1.

|`== Addressindex ==` methods. Commands I feel are important to this are |  |  |  |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| getaddressbalance | getaddresstxids | getaddressmempool | getaddressmempool |
| getaddressdeltas | getaddressutxos |  |  |
 
2.

| `== Wallet ==` methods. Commands I feel are important to this are  |                       |                      |                       |
|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
|  addmultisigaddress |      dumpprivkey      |     getnewaddress    | getunconfirmedbalance |
|    importprivkey    | instantsendtoaddress  |     importpubkey     |     keypoolrefill     |
|     importwallet    | listreceivedbyaddress |       sendmany       |      signmessage      |
|  abandontransaction |       dumpwallet      |    gettransaction    |     getwalletinfo     |
|     backupwallet    |     encryptwallet     | getreceivedbyaddress |     importaddress     |
|    listsinceblock   |    listtransactions   |      listunspent     |     sendtoaddress     |

3.

| `= Blockchain ==` methods. Commands I feel are important to this are |  |  |  |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|
| getbestblockhash | getblockheader | getrawmempool | gettxoutproof |
| getblock | getblockheaders | getspentinfo | gettxoutsetinfo |
| getblockchaininfo | getchaintips | gettxout | verifychain |
| getblockcount | getdifficulty |  | verifytxoutproof |
| getblockhash | getmempoolinfo |  |  |

4.

| ` == Dash == `methods. Commands I feel are important to this are | |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| privatesend | voteraw |

**ALL** fuctions are going to be named exactly as they are called. The parameters of these functions are going to be the arguments, respectively. 

##NOTE: 

Have some other method I should call? *make a pull request directly here, make an issue, or write the code! Thanks*

###Reasoning for having this info in the README is because I wanted to inform people of what's going on in the beginning project. Eventually I will put this in a *fancy* TODO



*Lets get this party started!!!*
